This is a very simple ZeroMQ-powered script that will take messages received when away and forward them via SMS to a mobile phone using Google Voice.  It's absurdly dependency-heavy:

    - Weechat
        - zmq_notify plugin
            - Ruby
            - ZMQ Ruby Gem

    - Python 2
        - ZMQ bindings for Python
        - PyYAML
        - pygooglevoice

Installation and configuration is very simple:

    0. Install all of that crap.

    1. If you don't have ~/.gvoice, run python and import googlevoice.  This
       will create a template ~/.gvoice for you to edit.
    
    2. Run irc2sms.py -h to find out the command line options.
